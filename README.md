# macroAssembler-edits
Edits to the Macro Assembler for Comp Org

## Added Capabilities

- proper pathing (relative to the first argument passed to the script)
- whitespace in C instructions
- Passing .tst as an argument
- Running CPUEmulator after assembling

## Example Execution

In order to run the example file and get expected results, use the following command:

`./tools/macroAssembler.py ./example-absvaladd/AbsValAddTest.tst`

Which should print information followed by "End of script - Comparison ended successfully"
